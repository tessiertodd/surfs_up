## Overview of the statistical analysis
We are helping A Wavy to analyse the temperature in Hawaii as he is looking to open a surf shop in Oahu.  He is wanting to understand if a surf and ice cream shop is a business that can be profitable year-round venture before investing in a store.  We will be using temperature data from various stations in the area and comparing June temperatures across several years to December temperatures (also across several years) - comparing various statistical measures for each of these two comparison months.  

## Results

![Table June_and December_Temperature](https://github.com/tessiertodd/surfs_up/blob/main/Jun_Dec_temps_stats.png)

- The average temperature in June is almost 4 degrees higher than December.

- The minimum temperature in December drops to 56 degrees, which is pretty cold to be in the water, while June's minimum is 64 degrees.

- 75% of the time, the temperature is 73 or higher in June and 69 or higher in December.

- An additional interesting observation is that there are more temperature measures in June at 1,700 while only 1,517 in December even though December has one more day than June.  This may be related to the Christmas holidays, possibly some days of temperature readings not being taken.



## Summary

There will need to be 90,398 roles filled over the next few years as those who are eligible take their retirement... with 1,549 current employees eligible for mentorships, that would mean that PH would have to go external to hire 88,849 people.

When we look at the breakdown of people close to retirement by title vs. the mentorship eligible employees - there will be a big gap that will have to be filled by external hires or headcount would have to be reduced (of course other challenges with that).

There are many retirement-ready people who could train the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees, but new hires would have to happen quickly to ensure there is time for the close to retirement employees have the time to properly train current PH employees as well as new hires that must occur to fill the impending gaps.  There are however not enough mentorship-eligible employees if PH limits this program to only those born in 1965, they may want to expand to include younger employees to ensure more knowledge transfer can happen before the huge wave of retirement.
