## Overview of the statistical analysis
We are helping W. Avy to analyse the temperature in Hawaii as he is looking to open a surf shop in Oahu.  He is wanting to understand if a surf and ice cream shop is a business that can be profitable year-round venture before investing in a store.  We will be using temperature data from various stations in the area and comparing June temperatures across several years to December temperatures (also across several years) - comparing various statistical measures for each of these two comparison months.  

## Results

![Table June_and December_Temperature](https://github.com/tessiertodd/surfs_up/blob/main/Jun_Dec_temps_stats.png)

- The average temperature in June is almost 4 degrees higher than December.

- The minimum temperature in December drops to 56 degrees, which is pretty cold to be in the water, while June's minimum is 64 degrees.

- 75% of the time, the temperature is 73 or higher in June and 69 or higher in December.

- Its interesting that the max temperature in June is only 2 degrees higher than max temperature in December... maybe those are anomalies or normal to get some very warm days in December along with some that are not quite so warm.

- An additional interesting observation is that there are more temperature measures in June at 1,700 while only 1,517 in December even though December has one more day than June.  This may be related to the Christmas holidays, possibly some days of temperature readings not being taken.


## Summary

### Recommendation Based on Temperature Analysis
Provided 69 degrees F is considered warm enough for surfers to get out and brave the water (at 20C its warm but not hot), even in December we would expect surfers to get out and be at the shop at least 75% of the days and June that % is higher.  Given the overall temperature statistics at two very different times in the year, I believe its fair to say that Oahu would be a good place for a surf shop.  It would also be important to have an understanding of how temperature affects ice-cream sales, to help A Wavy understand the potential with the ice-cream opporunity as well as the surfs shop revenue.

### Additional Weather Metrics to Analyze - Level of Precipitation
It might also be a good idea to take a look at not only the temperatures in June and December, but also the precipitation levels and the statistics in each month around that measure. It might help us understand how many good surfing days we should expect in each of these months.  While adding in precipitation, we may want to plot on a chart the temperatures vs. precipitation to see if there are any correlations.

### Additional Weather Metrics to Gather and Analyze - Wind Speed
While wind speed is not something we currently have available, it would be worth getting some of that data to be able to analyze the metric for June and December.  Wind speed would give us an idea of the quality of the surfing conditions, which is likely related to the number of surfers that would be out on a given day.  We may also want to consider comparing to other metrics we have analyzed to see if there are correlations that could help us ensure we are putting this business in the right location.
